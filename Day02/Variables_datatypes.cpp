    cout << "4.Spaces are not allowed in variable names." << endl;

    cout << "5.C++ is case-sensitive (num, Num, NUM are different)." << endl;

    cout << "6.Keywords (like int, for, while) cannot be used as names." << endl;

    cout << "7.It can be initialized at declaration." << endl;

    cout << "8.Always generate meaningful, descriptive names for readability." << endl;

    cout << "9.Local variables exist inside functions; global variables exist outside." << endl;

    cout << "10.Following rules avoids errors and improves code quality." << endl;
